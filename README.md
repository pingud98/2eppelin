# 2eppelin
I'm building a blimp.
It'll be 2.5m long, approx 1m wide. flying altitude circa 1300m max, with remote control; i plan to fly it in visual range for starters;
also I'm worried it'll be too heavy to actually fly; rough calcs indicate it should weigh 1000g
and have 1060g of lift!

Struts are designed.
Next: Nosecone + tailcone + control surfaces, then electronics and solar panel hangers and battery storage.
Eventually: Software for the autopilot and a gas generator for extended duration flights.
